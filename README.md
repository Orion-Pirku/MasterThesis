###Brief Overview

My thesis focuses on the computational identification of meiotic recombination hotspots in bird populations of *Sylvia atricapilla* (European Blackcap). Understanding the mechanisms and functionality of these recombination hotspots in birds is crucial, particularly because they lack the *Prdm9* gene.

The *Prdm9* gene plays a significant role in determining the locations of meiotic recombination hotspots in mammals, squamates, and chondrichthyes. It does so by placing histone trimethylation marks on H3K4 (Histone 3 Lysine 4). These trimethylation marks together with **PRDM9** protein, in turn, recruit the recombination machinery to the designated hotspot regions. However, the same marks are also found by default in promoters, which is why the role of *Prdm9* is so vital in pinpointing the actual hotspots. Failure to do so may result in asymmetric hotspots in sister chromatids, leading to extensive DNA damage and failure of meiosis.

Birds, on the other hand, lack *Prdm9* but are still able to conduct meiotic recombination without any apparent issues. This observation raises important questions: Why are birds able to conduct meiotic recombination without *Prdm9*? How are they able to perform meiotic recombination? Where are the hotspots placed in the bird genomes, and is there a way to identify jospots and to characterize their properties?
